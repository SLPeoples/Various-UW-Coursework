#SY110 Course Goals

The fundamental goal of SY110 is that students acquire:

1. A principled understanding of the basic physical and virtual architecture of the cyber domain, focusing on: the individual computer and program, the physical components and protocols of a network and the Internet, and the distributed client-server system that is the World Wide Web;

2. Hands on experience with basic components of the physical and virtual architecture in the cyber domain and the ability to relate that experience to the larger system;

3. A principled understanding of DoD's Pillars of Cyber Security (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Non-repudiation, Authentication), the inherent vulnerabilities of information systems that endanger these properties, defensive measures to ensure that information systems retain these properties, and offensive measures that can be used to violate these pillars; and

4. Hands on experience with some basic offensive and defensive practices in the cyber domain, and the ability to relate that experience to new or more sophisticated attacks and defenses.
