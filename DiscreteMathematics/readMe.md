# Course Description

Introduction to methods of discrete mathematics, including topics from graph theory, networkflows,  and  combinatorics,  with  emphasis  on  using  these  tools  to  formulate  models  and  solveproblems arising in variety of applications, such as computer science, biology, and managementscience.

# Course Learning Goals

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Demonstrate the ability to use the mathematical methods presented in this class, in-cluding graph theoretical methods, stochastic methods, Monte Carlo methods, Markovchains, linear programming, and integer programming.

* Apply the mathematical methods presented in this course to solve real-world problems.

* Formulate discrete mathematical models for a wide variety of real-world situations.

# Tentative List of Course Topics

Depending on the interests of the students enrolled, the course topics may change somewhat. Listed below are the topics that I plan to cover.

1. Basic Computer Programming.All of the discrete mathematical methods discussedin this course are designed to be implemented on a computer.  This will require somecomputer programing on your part.  We will discuss some basic programming methods.

2. Graph Theory.There are a lot of applications of graph theory, including operationsresearch (e.g.  scheduling) and electrical engineering (e.g.  communications networks).The  course  will  cover  enough  basic  graph  theory  to  approach  some  real-world  prob-lems, including branch and bound algorithms, Dijkstras algorithm, Kruskas and Primsalgorithms.

3. Markov  Model.Many  real-world  problems,  change  over  time  happens  in  discretesteps, and what will happen in the immediate future depends only on information aboutthe present state of things (and not the past; it is a memoryless process). Such situationslend themselves to analysis using Markov chains.  Markov chains can be described usingvectors and matrices.  The course will cover Markov chains and review some basic linearalgebra so that a variety of real-world problems may be solved, including problems frombiology, computer science, economics, and other fields.

4. Monte  Carlo  Methods  and  Probability.In  certain  kinds  of  real-world  applica-tions,  there  is  an  element  of  uncertainty  concerning  what  may  or  may  not  happen.Monte Carlo methods are experiments that use random numbers to simulate real-worldsituations.  These experiments can be carried out many times on computers, and theaggregate  results  from  these  experiements  can  be  analyzed  using  probabilistic  meth-ods  to  understand  what  is  likely  to  happen  in  the  real-world.   The  course  will  coverenough probability theory and examples of Monte Carlo methods to prepare studentsfor modeling some interesting real-world problems.

5. Linear Programming.This is a powerful set of methods that find optimum solutionsto  problems  in  which  there  are  many  possible  solutions.   The  methods  are  use  basicalgebra,  but  the  problems  are  sufficiently  complicated  that  computers  typically  needto be employed to find solutions in a reasonable amount of time.  We will discuss themathematical methods and some nice real-world applications.
