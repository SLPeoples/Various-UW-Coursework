# Course description: 

Stochastic concepts including probabilistic underpinnings of statistics, measures of central tendency, variability, correlation, distributions, sampling, and simulation. Exploratory data analysis including experiments, surveys, measures of association and inferential statistics. Credit is not given for both STMATH 341 and STMATH 390. Prerequisite: STMATH 124

# Course Objectives:  

At the end of this course, students should be able to:

1. Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods, and determine how they affect the scope of inference.

2. Use statistical software to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis.

3. Have a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference.

4. Apply estimation and testing methods to analyze single variables or the relationship between two variables in order to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions.

5. Model numerical response variables using a single or multiple explanatory variables. 6. Interpret results correctly, effectively, and in context without relying on statistical jargon.

7. Critique data-based claims and evaluate data-based decisions.
