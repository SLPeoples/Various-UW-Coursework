# Course Description:

* PHYS 122is an introductory laboratory science course designed specifically for engineers and physical science majors.  The lab is required and averaged into your overall course grade as outlined below.  If you are not pursuing one of those majors, you may bein the wrong class.

* PHYS 122 will provide a foundation for most of the subsequent courses in your major.  Success in this class will make future courses in your major significantly easier.

# Course Learning Goals: 

1. Identify and analyze misconceptionsof mechanics concepts previously held in order to modify them and build on correct knowledge [Bloom’s Level: Analyzing]

2. Communicate mechanics knowledge gained using both written and verbal methods in order to defend individual and group reasoning, and to inform a diverse audience [Bloom’s Level: Evaluating]

3. Analyze and solve physics problems using an expert approach in order to identify main concepts, logically progress through problems, and increase confidence and use of symbolic manipulation [Bloom’s Level: Analyzing]

4. Apply physics concepts learned in class to experiments and vice versa, formulate testable questions, implement corresponding experiments, and take accurate and consistent measurements in order to connect the importance of experiment to the study of physics, and to evaluate measurements’ limitations and meaning [Bloom’s Level: Creating/Evaluating]

5. Troubleshoot and revise unsuccessful attempts in order to learn from and correct mistakes [Bloom’s Level: Analyzing]

6. Choose and apply techniques to resolve group conflict, and collaborate with group members, in order to function effectively in a team environment [Bloom’s Level: Applying]
