We live in an increasingly technological world, a world in which there is a high demand for workers in technological STEM fields which are based on a solid understanding of mathematics.  However there are many people who cannot participate in these lucrative, high-demand fields because they are not adequately prepared in mathematics.  Just like the sharecroppers in the early part of the 20th century who couldn't get jobs in the newly industrialized society because they could not read or write, people who are not quantitatively literate do not have the same access to career choices as their more well-prepared peers.  Since Algebra is the gateway course to higher mathematics, Algebra is equivalent to the next civil rights front.  

As mathematicians and teachers of mathematics, how are we helping others gain quantitative literacy? And how are we thinking about it ourselves?  Is quantitative literacy just being able to perform algebraic manipulations over and over again using the correct procedure?  Or is it something more? In this course we will study algebraic habits of mind, questioning techniques, mathematical structure, symbol sense, and multiple representations.  The course is targeted both towards students interested in using mathematics in their own work, as well as interested in teaching others how to visualize and interpret algebraic concepts.

In addition to participating in weekly online class discussions regarding the course readings, students will work in groups (either virtually or face to face as you arrange it) to complete algebraic tasks, reflect individually on the reasoning behind those tasks, review three virtual manipulatives,  and a final project. The class is open to senior undergraduate students and graduate students. Basic working knowledge of EXCEL, and a willingness to learn new mathematical software of Fathom and Geogebra will be essential to success in this course. 

# Learning Goals & Objectives

Students should be able to: 

1. Employ research-based methods and materials, including technology and manipulative tools, for developing algebraic thinking from upper elementary grades through College Algebra

2. Solve algebraic tasks, prepare tasks for developing algebraic thinking, and reflect on their own thinking process when solving algebraic tasks as well as analysis of others’ thinking

3. Explore social and political issues related to the “Algebra for All” movement in schools and the importance of algebraic thinking for success in everyday living as well as mathematics and science careers. 

4. Read and interpret research results and classroom-based articles that describe students’ algebraic thinking

5. Explore the needs and conditions of all learners of mathematics as it applies to developing algebraic thinking
