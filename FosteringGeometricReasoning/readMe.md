This course focuses on the teaching and learning of geometry from a developmental perspective, including research-based methods for developing students' geometric thinking and structure and processes. A main issue addressed is how students develop geometric ideas from upper elementary grades through formal geometry.

Students enrolled in this course are offered a research-based and multi-faceted look at issues regarding the learning and teaching of geometry.  The course will focus on the development of geometric reasoning through the mathematics of “space” -- spatial reasoning, measure, estimation, dimension, form (shape), and proof.  A key objective of the course is for students to understand and appreciate how geometry is integrated into other mathematical domains such as numeracy and algebra. 

Based on scholarly work, the course will continually weave together four major themes:

1. The nature of geometry as a domain of mathematics (including historical perspectives),
2. A constructivist-based analysis of math students’ geometric reasoning and learning,
3. The role of technology and mathematical modeling in fostering geometric reasoning, and
4. The nature and role of geometric proof across grade levels. 

# Driving questions include: 

* What are the most powerful geometric concepts, ideas, and methods (including modeling techniques) that are accessible to learners?

To try and answer this question about learning, you will be reading and analyzing relevant literature. It is imperative that we understand what has been researched and what methods of research have been used regarding student learning in geometry.

* How can we link theory and practice in the teaching and learning of geometry across the K-16 mathematics curricula?

We will explore pedagogical content ideas and methods when teaching geometry topics. Our understanding of these ideas and methods will be relevant for several grade levels in K-16.
We will also reflect upon our own experiences and beliefs about mathematics. We will look at mathematics as a discipline, and, based on the presented research literature, compare more traditional ideas about what it means to ‘know’ and ‘do’ mathematics to the vision of mathematics advocated by the reform movements as well as what it means to ‘know’ and ‘do’ mathematics relying on constructivist principles on learning and teaching.        

# Teaching strategies: Class discussions, group work, reflection, small group planning, course readings, geometric tasks
