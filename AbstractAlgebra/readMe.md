# Course Description:

Introduction to group theory. Emphasis placed on examples, including cyclic, dihedral, and symmetric groups. Theoretical concepts include: Cosets and Lagrange’s Theorem; direct products; homomorphisms, normal subgroups, quotient groups, and the fundamentalisomorphism theorems; orders and Cauchy’s theorem; the structure of finitely-generated abelian groups.

# Student Learning Objectives:  

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to do the following:

1. Learn the basic definitions, concepts, questions, and intellectual thrust of contemporary group theory.

2. Connect course concepts (e.g., associativity, commutativity, etc.) to ideas students are already familiar with.

3. Gain familiarity with a wide array of examples, including cyclic and dihedral groups, symmetric groups, and finite groups in general.

4. Develop and utilize the basic theory of homomorphisms, normal subgroups, quotient groups, and the fundamental isomorphism theorems.

5. Develop the theory of finitely-generated abelian groups.

6. Apply basic theoretical results to the problem of classifying groups of a fixed (small) order.

7. Assimilate the vocabulary of the subject and use it to communicate ideas clearly and precisely. In particular, develop and refine the ability to read and write mathematical proofs.
